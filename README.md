# Infra & Cloud Bootcamp Project

### Overview
This project demonstrates setting up a cloud-based infrastructure using AWS EC2 and S3.

### What I Completed
✅ Configured Git and GitHub SSH keys  
✅ Installed AWS CLI and verified connection  
✅ Created and connected to an EC2 instance  
✅ Deployed a working Node.js app (`index.js`) on EC2  
✅ Created an S3 bucket and uploaded a static website file (`index.html`)

### Notes
- EC2 app runs on port 3000  
- S3 bucket hosts a simple static HTML page  
- Some advanced steps (RDS, Terraform, CI/CD) were not fully implemented but are outlined in future plans.
